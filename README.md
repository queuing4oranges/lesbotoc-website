# Lesbotoƒç.cz

## Project Overview

I have been asked to do this project for a group organizing events for queer women in Prague. The organization wanted a simple, well structured website which should include a calendar with events that also allow for sign ups, a gallery to show images from past events, as well as a section about themselves and a way to contact them.
(The organisation is currently being restructured and will be rebranded in the near future. For this reason and to preserve and showcase my work, the website is being hosted on a subdomain).
